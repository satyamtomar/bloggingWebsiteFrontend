                Once upon a time, I met the person I’d been asking the universe for. We even met in the exact way I would have wanted to.

 I was on a solo rock-climbing road trip and through a series of fateful and unlikely events, we happened to be the only two people staying on a remote farm.

The first evening we met, we had a deep conversation late into the night. From that moment on, we were joined at the hip. We had a roaring adventure — climbing, making love, and road-tripping our way through the country. We poured our souls out and helped each other through tough times. By the end of that road trip, I had committed to moving to his state.

It seemed like the perfect fairy tale. And yet, it wasn’t.

There wasn’t a single moment where I was emotionally secure but there were many moments where I felt deeply lonely.

It was confusing. Wasn’t this exactly what I wanted?
